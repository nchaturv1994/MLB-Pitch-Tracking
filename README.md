# MLB-Pitch-Tracking

### Recreating the database and visualizations found at baseballsavant.com

This repository downloads data from Statcast and Pitch F/X data and attempts to recreate some of the visualizations that can be found on the site. The code used to download the data relies heavily on the [baseball-scraper](https://pypi.org/project/baseball-scraper/) library, while the data itself is downloaded from [BaseballSavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/).
